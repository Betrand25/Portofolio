# Portofolio
Welcome to my website portfolio, a platform designed to showcase my work, awards I have won, experience I have, and contact information for collaborations.

This website contains a collection of projects that I have created, ranging from website development, applications, to prototype designs. Each project is equipped with a description, technology used, and final results that can be seen directly.

Apart from that, I also share the awards I have achieved as a form of appreciation for my dedication and hard work in my field. The experience section describes my professional journey, including roles, responsibilities and lessons learned on various occasions.

For those of you interested in working together, I provide easily accessible contact information, including email and social media, to make communication easier.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to a fruitful relationship in the future!
